# AST Folder

A place where _generated_ content will be placed. This includes:

-   **AST info**: this acts as a sort of "cache" of what was used to build the
    current index
-   **Sitemap**: a JSON file indicating the sitemap of Markdown documents ...
    this is done on a per repo, per branch manner where files are
    `sitemap-[repo]-[branch]`
