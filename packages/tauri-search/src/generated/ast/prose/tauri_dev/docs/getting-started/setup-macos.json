System Dependencies&nbsp;<Icon title=\"alert\" color=\"danger\"/>\n\n\nYou will need to have <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\" target=\"_blank\">Homebrew</a> installed to run the following command.\n\n```sh\n$ brew install gcc\n```\n\nYou will also need to make sure `xcode` is installed.\n\n```sh\n$ xcode-select --install\n```\n\n## 2. Node.js Runtime and Package Manager&nbsp;<Icon title=\"control-skip-forward\" color=\"warning\"/>\n\n### Node.js (npm included)\n\nWe recommend using nvm to manage your Node.js runtime. It allows you to easily switch versions and update Node.js.\n\n```sh\n$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n<Alert title=\"Note\">\nWe have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to look at it first. Here is the file as a mere <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh\" target=\"_blank\">download link</a>.\n</Alert>\n\nOnce nvm is installed, close and reopen your terminal, then install the latest version of Node.js and npm:\n\n```sh\n$ nvm install node --latest-npm\n$ nvm use node\n```\n\nIf you have any problems with nvm, please consult their <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\">project readme</a>.\n\n### Optional Node.js Package Manager\n\nYou may want to use an alternative to npm:\n\n- <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn</a>, is preferred by Tauri's team\n- <a href=\"https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation\" target=\"_blank\">pnpm</a>\n\n## 3. Rustc and Cargo Package Manager&nbsp;<Icon title=\"control-skip-forward\" color=\"warning\"/>\n\nThe following command will install <a href=\"https://rustup.rs/\" target=\"_blank\">rustup</a>, the official installer for <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Rust</a>.\n\n```\n$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n```\n\n<Alert title=\"Note\">\nWe have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do.
