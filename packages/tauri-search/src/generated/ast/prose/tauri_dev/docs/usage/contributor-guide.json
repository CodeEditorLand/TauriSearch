In the Tauri root directory, there is a `.scripts` folder that contains a set of scripts to automate adding a couple temporary environment variables to your shell/terminal. These environment variables point to directories in the test fixture which will prevent RLS from crashing on compile-time. This is a necessary step for setting up a development environment for Tauri's Rust libraries.\n\n##### _Example Instructions_\n\n1. Navigate to the Tauri Root directory.\n2. Execute a script based on your Operating System from this folder: `.scripts/init_env.bat` for Windows Cmd, `.scripts/init_env.ps1` for Windows Powershell, `. .scripts/init_env.sh` for Linux/macOS bash (note the first `.` in this command).\n3. Open your text editor/IDE from this shell/terminal.\n\n## Hands On Example\n\nLet's make a new example. That's a great way to learn. We are going to assume you are on a nixy type of environment like Linux or macOS and have all of your development dependencies like rust and node already sorted out.\n\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:tauri-apps/tauri.git\ncd tauri/cli/tauri.js\nyarn\nmkdir ../../examples/vanillajs && cd \"$_\"\n```\n\n```json\n  \"tauri:source\": \"node ../../../cli/tauri.js/bin/tauri\",\n```\n\n```ini\n  [dependencies.tauri]\n  path = \"../../../../core/tauri\"\n  features = [ \"all-api\" ]\n```\n","h1":[],"h2":[{"content":"Contribution Flow","type":"text"},{"content":"Hands On Example","type":"text"}],"h3":[{"content":"A Note About Contributions to the Rust Libraries","type":"text"}],"hasCodeBlock":true,"programmingLanguages":["sh","json","ini"],"otherSymbols":["text","list","inlineCode","h5"]}
