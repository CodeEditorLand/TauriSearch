Build Your Web App\n\nNow that you are ready to package your project, you will need to run your framework's or bundler's build command (assuming you're using one, of course).\n\n<Alert title=\"Note\">\nEvery framework has its own publishing tooling. It is outside of the scope of this document to treat them all or keep them up to date.\n</Alert>\n\n### 2. Bundle your application with Tauri\n\n<Command name=\"build\" />\n\nThis command will embed your web assets into a single binary with your Rust code. The binary itself will be located in `src-tauri/target/release/[app name]`, and installers will be located in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.\n\nLike the `tauri dev` command, the first time you run this, it will take some time to collect the Rust crates and build everything - but on subsequent runs it will only need to rebuild your code, which is much quicker.\n","h1":[],"h2":[],"h3":[{"content":"1","type":"text"},{"content":"2","type":"text"}],"hasCodeBlock":false,"programmingLanguages":[],"otherSymbols":["text","inlineCode"]}
