There is no support for any versions other than latest.\n</Alert>\n\n## Automatic updates\n\nThe Tauri JS CLI has a command to install and update all needed dependencies, just run `tauri deps install` or `tauri deps update`.\n\n## Manual updates\n\n### Update NPM Packages\n\nIf you are using the `tauri` package:\n```bash\n$ yarn upgrade @tauri-apps/cli @tauri-apps/api --latest\n$ npm install @tauri-apps/cli@latest @tauri-apps/api@latest\n```\nYou can also detect what the latest version of Tauri is on the command line, using:\n- `npm outdated @tauri-apps/cli`\n- `yarn outdated @tauri-apps/cli`\n\nAlternatively, if you are using the `vue-cli-plugin-tauri` approach:\n```bash\n$ yarn upgrade vue-cli-plugin-tauri --latest\n$ npm install vue-cli-plugin-tauri@latest\n```\n\n### Update Cargo Packages\nGo to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and change `tauri` to\n`tauri = { version = \"%version%\" }` where `%version%` is the version number shown above. (You can just use the `MAJOR.MINOR`) version, like `0.9`.\n\nThen do the following:\n```bash\n$ cd src-tauri\n$ cargo update -p tauri\n```\nYou can also run `cargo outdated -r tauri` to get direct information about the core library's latest version.\n","h1":[],"h2":[{"content":"Automatic updates","type":"text"},{"content":"Manual updates","type":"text"}],"h3":[{"content":"Update NPM Packages","type":"text"}],"hasCodeBlock":false,"programmingLanguages":[],"otherSymbols":["text","inlineCode"]}
