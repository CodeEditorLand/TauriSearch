Enable it with the <a href=\"/docs/api/config#tauri.bundle.deb.useBootstrapper\">`useBootstrapper`</a> config.\n\n# Custom files\n\nTo include custom files to the debian package, you can configure a mapping on `tauri.conf.json > tauri > bundle > deb > files` as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tauri\": {\n    \"bundle\": {\n      \"deb\": {\n        \"files\": {\n          \"/usr/lib/README.md\": \"../README.md\", // copies the README.md file to /usr/lib/README.md\n          \"usr/lib/assets\": \"../public/\" // copies the entire public directory to /usr/lib/assets\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Alert title=\"Note\" icon=\"info-alt\">\nEach `files` object key is the path on the debian package, and the value is a path to a file or directory relative to the `tauri.conf.json` file.\n</Alert>\n","h1":[{"content":"Bootstrapper","type":"text"},{"content":"Custom files","type":"text"}],"h2":[],"h3":[],"hasCodeBlock":true,"programmingLanguages":["json"],"otherSymbols":["text","inlineCode"]}
