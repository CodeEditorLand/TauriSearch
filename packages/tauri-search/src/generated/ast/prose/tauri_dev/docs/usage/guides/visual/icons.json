This is probably NOT what you want when you ship your application. To remedy this common situation, Tauri provides the `icon` command that will take an input file and create all the icons needed for the various platforms:\n\n<Command name=\"icon\"/>\n\n```sh\nOptions\n  --help, -h          Displays this message\n  --log, l            Logging [boolean]\n  --icon, i           Source icon (png, 1240x1240 with transparency)\n  --target, t         Target folder (default: 'src-tauri/icons')\n  --compression, c    Compression type [pngquant|optipng|zopfli]\n```\n\nThese will be placed in your `src-tauri/icons` folder where they will automatically be included in your built app.\n\nIf you need to source your icons from some other location, you can edit this part of the `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tauri\": {\n    \"bundle\": {\n      \"icon\": [\n        \"icons/32x32.png\",\n        \"icons/128x128.png\",\n        \"icons/128x128@2x.png\",\n        \"icons/icon.icns\",\n        \"icons/icon.ico\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Alert type=\"info\" icon=\"info-alt\" title=\"Note on filetypes\">\n\n  - icon.icns = macOS\n  - icon.ico = MS Windows\n  - \\*.png = Linux\n\n</Alert>\n","h1":[],"h2":[],"h3":[],"hasCodeBlock":true,"programmingLanguages":["sh","json"],"otherSymbols":["text","inlineCode","list"]}
