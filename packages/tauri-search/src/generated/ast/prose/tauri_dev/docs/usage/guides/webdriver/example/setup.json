To have a\nproject to test on in the next two sections, we are going to set up an extremely minimal Tauri application for use in\nour testing. We will not use the Tauri CLI, any frontend dependencies or build steps, and not be bundling the\napplication afterwards. This is to showcase exactly a minimal suite to show off adding WebDriver testing to an existing\napplication.\n\nIf you just want to see the finished example project that utilizes what will be shown in this example guide, then you\ncan see https://github.com/chippers/hello_tauri.\n\n## Initializing a Cargo Project\n\nWe want to create a new binary Cargo project to house this example application. We can easily do this from the command\nline with `cargo new hello-tauri-webdriver --bin` which will scaffold a minimal binary Cargo project for us. This\ndirectory will serve as the working directory for the rest of this guide, so make sure commands you run are inside this\nnew `hello-tauri-webdriver/` directory.\n\n## Creating a Minimal Frontend\n\nWe will create a minimal HTML file to act as the frontend to our example application. We will also be using a few things\nfrom this frontend later during our WebDriver tests.\n\nFirst, let's create our Tauri `distDir` that we know we will need once building the Tauri portion of the application.\n`mkdir dist` should create a new directory called `dist/` in which we will be placing the following `index.html` file.\n\n`dist/index.html`:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Hello Tauri!</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            /* Add a nice colorscheme */\n            background-color: #222831;\n            color: #ececec;\n\n            /* Make the body the exact size of the window */\n            margin: 0;\n            height: 100vh;\n            width: 100vw;\n\n            /* Vertically and horizontally center children of the body tag */\n            display: flex;\n            justify-content: center;\n            align-items: center;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Hello, Tauri!</h1>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Adding Tauri to the Cargo Project\n\nNext, we will add some necessary items to make our Cargo project into a Tauri project. First, is adding the dependencies\nto the Cargo Manifest (`Cargo.toml`) so that Cargo knows to pull in our dependencies while building.\n\n`Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"hello-tauri-webdriver\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2018\"\n\n# Needed to set up some things for Tauri at build time\n[build-dependencies]\ntauri-build = \"1.0.0-beta.4\"\n\n# The actual Tauri dependency, along with `custom-protocol` to serve the pages.\n[dependencies]\ntauri = { version = \"1.0.0-beta.6\", features = [\"custom-protocol\"] }\n\n# Make --release build a binary that is small (opt-level = \"s\") and fast (lto = true).\n# This is completely optional, but shows that testing the application as close to the\n# typical release settings is possible. Note: this will slow down compilation.\n[profile.release]\nincremental = false\ncodegen-units = 1\npanic = \"abort\"\nopt-level = \"s\"\nlto = true\n```\n\nAs you may have noticed, we added a `[build-dependency]`. To use the build dependency, we must use it from a build\nscript. We will create one now at `build.rs`.\n\n`build.rs`:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    // Only watch the `dist/` directory for recompiling, preventing unnecessary\n    // changes when we change files in other project subdirectories.\n    println!(\"cargo:rerun-if-changed=dist\");\n\n    // Run the Tauri build-time helpers\n    tauri_build::build()\n}\n```\n\nWith all that setup, our Cargo Project now knows how to pull in and build our Tauri dependencies. Let's finish making\nthis minimal example a Tauri application by setting up Tauri in the actual project code. We will be editing\nthe `src/main.rs`\nfile to add this Tauri functionality.\n\n`src/main.rs`:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    tauri::Builder::default()\n        .run(tauri::generate_context!())\n        .expect(\"unable to run Tauri application\");\n}\n```\n\nPretty simple, right?\n\n## Tauri Configuration\n\nWe are going to need 2 things to successfully build the application. First, we need an icon file. You can use any PNG\nfor this next part and copy it into `icon.png`. Typically, this will be provided as part of the scaffolding when you use\nthe Tauri CLI to create a project. To get the default Tauri icon, we can download the icon used by the Hello Tauri\nexample repository with the\ncommand `curl -L \"https://github.com/chippers/hello_tauri/raw/main/icon.png\" --output icon.png`.\n\nThe second thing we will need is a `tauri.conf.json` to specify some important configuration values to Tauri. Again,\nthis would typically come from the `tauri init` scaffolding command, but we will be creating our own minimal config\nhere.\n\n`tauri.conf.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"build\": {\n    \"distDir\": \"dist\"\n  },\n  \"tauri\": {\n    \"bundle\": {\n      \"identifier\": \"studio.tauri.hello_tauri_webdriver\",\n      \"icon\": [\n        \"icon.png\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"allowlist\": {\n      \"all\": false\n    },\n    \"windows\": [\n      {\n        \"width\": 800,\n        \"height\": 600,\n        \"resizable\": true,\n        \"fullscreen\": false\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI'll go over some of these. You can see the `dist/` directory we created earlier specified as the `distDir` property. We\nset a bundle identifier so that the built application has a unique id, along with setting the `icon.png` as the only\nicon. We aren't using any Tauri apis or features, so we just disable all them in `allowlist` by setting `\"all\": false`.\nThe window values just sets a single window to be created with some reasonable default values.\n\nAt this point, we have a basic Hello World application that when ran, should display a simple greeting.\n\n## Running the Example Application\n\nTo make sure we did it right, let's build this application! We will run this as a `--release` application because we\nwill also run our WebDriver tests with a release profile. Run `cargo run --release` and after some compiling we should\nsee the following application pop up.\n\n<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>\n    <img src={HelloTauriWebdriver}/>\n</div>\n\n_Note: If you are modifying the application and want to use the Devtools, then run it without `--release` and \"Inspect\nElement\" should be available in the right click menu._\n\nWe should now be ready to start testing this application with some WebDriver frameworks. This guide will go over both\n[WebdriverIO](webdriverio) and [Selenium](selenium) in that order.","h1":[],"h2":[{"content":"Initializing a Cargo Project","type":"text"},{"content":"Creating a Minimal Frontend","type":"text"},{"content":"Adding Tauri to the Cargo Project","type":"text"},{"content":"Tauri Configuration","type":"text"},{"content":"Running the Example Application","type":"text"}],"h3":[],"hasCodeBlock":true,"programmingLanguages":["html","toml","rust","json"],"otherSymbols":["text","link","inlineCode","em"]}
