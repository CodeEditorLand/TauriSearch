Tooling that is dedicated to it such as [tauri-driver] is still in\nactive development and may change as necessary over time. Additionally, only Windows and Linux are currently supported.\n</Alert>\n\n[WebDriver] is a standardized interface to interact with web documents that is primarily intended for automated testing.\nTauri supports the [WebDriver] interface by leveraging the native platform's [WebDriver] server underneath a\ncross-platform wrapper [`tauri-driver`].\n\n## System Dependencies\n\nInstall the latest [`tauri-driver`] or update an existing installation by running:\n\n```sh\ncargo install tauri-driver\n```\n\nBecause we currently utilize the platform's native [WebDriver] server, there are some requirements for running\n[`tauri-driver`] on supported platforms. Platform support is currently limited to Linux and Windows.\n\n### Linux\n\nWe use `WebKitWebDriver` on linux platforms. Check if this binary exists already (command `which WebKitWebDriver`) as\nsome distributions bundle it with the regular webkit package. Other platforms may have a separate package for them such\nas `webkit2gtk-driver` on Debian based distributions.\n\n### Windows\n\nMake sure to grab the version of [Microsoft Edge Driver] that matches your Windows' Edge version that the application is\nbeing built and tested on. On up-to-date Window installs, this should almost always be the latest stable version. If the\ntwo versions do not match, you may experience your WebDriver testing suite hanging while trying to connect.\n\nThe download contains a binary called `msedgedriver.exe`. [`tauri-driver`] looks for that binary in the `$PATH` so make\nsure it's either available on the path or use the `--native-driver` option on [`tauri-driver`]. On Windows CI machines,\nyou may want to download this automatically as part of the CI setup process to ensure the Edge and Edge Driver versions\nstay in sync. A guide on how to do this may be added at a later date.\n\n## Example Application\n\nThe [next section](example/setup) of the guide will show step-by-step how to create a minimal example application that\nis tested with WebDriver.\n\nIf you prefer to just see the result of the guide and look over a finished minimal codebase that utilizes it then you\ncan look at https://github.com/chippers/hello_tauri. That example also comes with a CI script to test with GitHub\nactions, but you may still be interested in the [WebDriver CI](ci) guide as it explains the concept a bit more.\n\n[WebDriver]: https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/\n[`tauri-driver`]: https://crates.io/crates/tauri-driver\n[tauri-driver]: https://crates.io/crates/tauri-driver\n[Microsoft Edge Driver]: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/\n","h1":[],"h2":[{"content":"System Dependencies","type":"text"},{"content":"Example Application","type":"text"}],"h3":[{"content":"Linux","type":"text"},{"content":"Windows","type":"text"}],"hasCodeBlock":true,"programmingLanguages":["sh"],"otherSymbols":["text","inlineCode","link","def"]}
